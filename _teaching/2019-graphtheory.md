An introduction to graph theory concluding with an introduction to automata and formal languages.

Graph Theory
======
- Generality: oriented and un-oriented graphs, valued graphs, sub-graphs, degree, chain, path, connexity, strong connexity
- Graph traversal: Depth-first search, Breadth-first search
- Shortest path: Dijkstra algorithm
- Maximal flow problem: Flow, Cut, Maximum flow, Minimal cut, Ford-Fulkerson algorithm

Formal Languages
======
- Alphabet and words
- Regular language, regular expressions

Automata
======
- Synchronus and Asynchronus automata
- Determinist automata
- Automata and regular languages
- Unambiguous finite automata
