An introduction to probability theory concluding with an introduction to statistical tests.

Foundations of probability
======
- Probability axioms
- Events
- Mutually exclusive events
- Law of total probability
- Conditional probability
- Bayesâ€™ rule
- Independent events

Discrete random variables
======
- Definition of a random variable
- Cumulative distribution functions
- Examples: discrete uniform, bernoulli, binomial, geometric
- Independent random variables

Jointly distributed random variables
======
- Marginal distributions
- Conditional distributions
- Sum and product of random variables
- Expectation and variance of random variables
- Correlation

Continuous random variables
=======
- Probability density functions
- Examples: continuous uniform, gaussian
- Function of random variables
- Change of variables

Convergence
=====
- Convergence in law, convergence in probability
- Central limit theorem, weak law of large numbers
- Poisson distribution
- Approximation of binomial distribution by poisson or gaussian distributions

Statistical tests
====
- Principles of statistical tests
- Decision rule, risk, power, p-value
- Test comparisons
