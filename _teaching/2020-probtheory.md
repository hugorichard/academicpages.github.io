an introduction to probability theory concluding with an introduction to statistical tests.

foundations of probability
======
- probability axioms
- events
- mutually exclusive events
- law of total probability
- conditional probability
- bayesâ€™ rule
- independent events

discrete random variables
======
- definition of a random variable
- cumulative distribution functions
- examples: discrete uniform, bernoulli, binomial, geometric
- independent random variables

jointly distributed random variables
======
- marginal distributions
- conditional distributions
- sum and product of random variables
- expectation and variance of random variables
- correlation

continuous random variables
=======
- probability density functions
- examples: continuous uniform, gaussian
- function of random variables
- change of variables

convergence
=====
- convergence in law, convergence in probability
- central limit theorem, weak law of large numbers
- poisson distribution
- approximation of binomial distribution by poisson or gaussian distributions

statistical tests
====
- principles of statistical tests
- decision rule, risk, power, p-value
- test comparisons
