The shared response model provides a simple but effective framework to 
analyse fMRI data of subjects exposed to naturalistic stimuli.

However when the number of subjects or runs is large,
fitting the model requires a large amount of memory and
computational power, which limits its use in practice. 

The FastSRM algorithm provides considerable speed-up in time and memory usage, hence it allows easy and fast large-scale analysis of naturalistic-stimulus fMRI data. 

FastSRM is freely available: [https://github.com/hugorichard/FastSRM](https://github.com/hugorichard/FastSRM).
Vanillay SRM is not identifiable. In the last release of FastSRM, an identifiable version of FastSRM is available.
