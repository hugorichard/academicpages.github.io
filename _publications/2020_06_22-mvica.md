excerpt: 'An important goal of cognitive brain imaging studies is to model the functional organization of the brain; yet there exists currently no functional brain atlas built from existing data. One of the main road-blocks to the creation of such an atlas is the functional variability that is  observed  in  subjects  performing  the  same  task;  this  variability  goes far  beyond  anatomical  variability  in  brain  shape  and  size.  Function-based alignment procedures have recently been proposed in order to improve the correspondence of activation patterns across individuals. However, the corresponding computational solutions are costly and not well-principled. Here, we propose a new framework based on optimal transport theory to create such a template. We leverage entropic smoothing as an efficient means to create brain templates without losing fine-grain structural information; it is implemented in a computationally efficient way.  We  evaluate  our  approach  on  rich  multi-subject,  multi-contrasts datasets. These experiments demonstrate that the template-based inference procedure improves the transfer of information across individuals with respect to state of the art methods.'
