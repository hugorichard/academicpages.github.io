excerpt: 'The shared response model provides a simple but effective framework to analyse fMRI data of subjects exposed to naturalistic stimuli. However when the number of subjects or runs is large, fitting the model requires a large amount of memory and computational power, which limits its use in practice. The FastSRM algorithm relies on an intermediate atlas-based representation. It provides considerable speed-up in time and memory usage, hence it allows easy and fast large-scale analysis of naturalistic-stimulus fMRI data.'
